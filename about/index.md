title: About Me
---

My name is Tim Jacobs. I'm a PhD candidate at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel hill working in the field of protein design. Before
my career in science, I worked in the software development field, and as such my
graduate work focuses largely in the burgeoning field of computational biology. You can
find out more by perusing my LinkedIn account, or by delving into my various
projects hosted on GitHub.

Outside of science my interests include programming, cooking, and woodworking. As
this is my personal blog, you can expect to find posts surrounding all of these
hobbies.
