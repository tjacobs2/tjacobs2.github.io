#### Under the Hood Stuff #####

# Use rdiscount as the markdown engine because it generates html5 compliant code for stuff like footnotes

# If you don't have it install it via gem install rdiscount
markdown: rdiscount

# Makes pretty (descriptive) permalinks. See Jekyll docs for alternatives.
permalink: pretty

# Exclude metadata and development time dependencies (like Grunt plugins)
