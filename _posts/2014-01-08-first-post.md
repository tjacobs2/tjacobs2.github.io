###Blasting into the blogosphere

In an effort to develop my writing skills, increase my web presence, and play with cool web technologies, I've decided to start this personal website. I plan to use this space 
as a place to document my various projects and share my opinions about science and technology. 

To start off, it seems fitting to talk briefly about the infrastructure backend to this site. A while back a project I work on as part of my graduate work, [Rosetta](http://www.RosettaCommons.org),
switched from SVN to GIT. Fortunately, this switch forced me to become quite familiar with (thanks in large part to the excellent, and free, [Pro Git book.](http://git-scm.com/book)
Since then, I've completely drank the Koolaid. I love Git. My programming workflow has become so much more streamlined, and I'm addicted the natural portability. I can easily move
between my various machines at home and work, and it's as if I never left. I should note that this isn't entirely thanks to git, [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) plays a large
part in this portability as well, but that's a topic for another post, back to Git. Since our Rosetta transition, I've been quick to adopt any git-based technology I can. For instance,
I've lead an effort to move Rosetta documentation to a [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum), the git-driven wiki. In keeping with the git-theme, this site is hosted on [github](http://jekyllrb.com/), and is
driven by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which allows me to write my posts in 'plain text' (markdown, technically), and publish via a simple 'git push'. So far, things have been
working really well. I spent a bit of time picking a design (not my strong point, so I grabbed one from the experts over at [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net/)), and modifying it to
work with my Jekyll setup. I'm sure I'll have a lot more tweaking to do once I add some content; but for now, I'm happy. I'm happy to share my setup with anyone interested, just
send me an e-mail using the link at the bottom of the page. Alternatively, feel free to browse the source from [my github page](https://github.com/tjacobs2/tjacobs2.github.io).
